> Parse attributes of items from the official gw2 api

**:bomb: NOTE: This module is still heavily in development and the API might change completely. Please don't use it yet.**

## Install

```
npm install https://github.com/gw2efficiency/item-attribute-parsing
```

This module can be used for Node.js as well as browsers using [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook#how-node_modules-works).

(Note: Babel gets pulled in as a dependency, because the module is written in ES7 and 
gets compiled into ES5 during the installation. The Babel code is **not** included in the module, 
don't be shocked at the dependency tree. :wink:)
